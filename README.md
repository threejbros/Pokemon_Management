To Run on your local device: In console,
1) go to the "frontend" folder, and run "npm run dev"
2) go to the "backend" folder, and run "npm run start"
3) In your browser, run "localhost:3000"

More things I want to improve on that I forgot to note in my PDF/Powerpoint:
1) being able to run this project with a single command instead of having to do the above process. I will likely need a package.json folder in the root directory
2) Be able to run this on a AWS server. This will require me to make changes to my current code to be flexible for both production API urls vs development urls. Will need to handle based on environment variables
